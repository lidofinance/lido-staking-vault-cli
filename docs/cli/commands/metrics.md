## Exporting Metrics to CSV

Any table output produced by metrics commands can be exported to a CSV file using global flags.

**Flags:**

- `--csv <file>`: write table output to a CSV file

**Examples:**

Export statistics for last 24 reports:

```bash
yarn start metrics read statistic-by-reports 24 --vault <address> --csv ./stats.csv
```

Notes:

- Headers are included when present (e.g., timestamps in `statistic-by-reports` and `report-data`).
- Big integer values are serialized as strings.
